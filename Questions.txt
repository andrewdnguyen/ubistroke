\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Problems that we don\'92t know how to address
\f1\b0 .\
\
\ul General Questions\
\ulnone \
- What design questions should we try to answer? What merits a paper?\
	- Our Contributions: rehabilitation visualization tool and diagnostic tool\
	- We can improve diagnosis in terms of time and accuracy.\
	- What are the deliverables of a rehabilitation visualization tool?\
- How will clinicians use this rehab visualization tool we\'92ve developed so far?\
	- What is missing? What other information would they like? Is the layout fine?\
	- Where/how will it integrate into their current work flow?\
- What will clinicians need for a diagnosis tool used in ED/inpatient (\'93Start New Patient\'94)?\
	- Where/how will it integrate into their current work flow?\
- Will clinicians be our primary target user? What about EMS workers?
\
\ul Technical Questions\
\ulnone \
- How do we address the problem where data is missing (gaps in skeleton tracking)?\
- How do we deal with multiple skeletons tracked?\
- How would this tool work in
\f0\b real-time
\f1\b0 ? What resources would we need to make this happen?\
	- Need to convert image frames to video real-time\
	- Where will we store the data?\

\cf0 \ul \ulc0 Process for Getting Feedback for a Design Paper - Spring Quarter\ulnone \
\
1. Testing with fellows in-person during data collection sessions\
(Can Andrew specify smaller time frame during his data collection sessions to interview fellows/attendings so that Vish and Nadir can attend as well?)\
2. Gather fellows\'92 feedback, summarize it\
3. Meet with Kunal/Brett and discuss summary with them, and get their feedback on UI}
