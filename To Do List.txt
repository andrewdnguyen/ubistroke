Immediate Action Items\ulnone \
\
- Import 10 subjects worth of body files and videos and use those\ Need storage transfer Device
- Remove human outline\ DONE
- Remove transparency of the body parts\ DONE
- Use \'93Ubistroke ID\'94 instead of MR number as Subject ID\ DONE
- Highlight joints that are selected to be plotted, highlight the same color it\'92s displayed on the graph\ Need to rework current implementation.
- Create a gradient based on the NIHSS score of symptoms in the area\ WIP: Want to ask neurologists for more details.
- Move all the user options to the corner, above right side of chart\ DONE
- Add Z data user option\ See joint highlighting.
- Move \'93Hide Nodes\'94 into \'93User Options\'94\ DONE

\
\ul Medium Priority\
\ulnone \
- Time Machine like interface for same patient, multiple visits (fake older data)\
- Prep for Wizard of Oz study for \'93Start New Patient\'94\
- Replicate Lisa\'92s Balsmiq prototypes in the UI with fake data\
- Set up Virtual Machine (AWS) connected to Firebase DB\
\

- Look into other data visualization APIs\
- Click video at a timestamp, go to approximate spot in chart timeseries\
- Marker in time series chart, marker where you hover in the chart with your mouse\
- See how UI looks on different browsers, different screen sizes (the positions of the chart, User Options, human body, etc. should move accordingly)\

\cf0 \ul \ulc0 Process for Getting Feedback for a Design Paper - Spring Quarter\ulnone \
\
1. Testing with fellows in-person during data collection sessions\
(Can Andrew specify smaller time frame during his data collection sessions to interview fellows/attendings so that Vish and Nadir can attend as well?)\
2. Gather fellows\'92 feedback, summarize it\
3. Meet with Kunal/Brett and discuss summary with them, and get their feedback on UI}
