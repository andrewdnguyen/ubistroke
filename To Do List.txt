\cf0 \ul \ulc0 Process for Getting Feedback for a Design Paper - Spring Quarter\ulnone \
\
1. Testing with fellows in-person during data collection sessions\
(Can Andrew specify smaller time frame during his data collection sessions to interview fellows/attendings so that Vish and Nadir can attend as well?)\
2. Gather fellows\'92 feedback, summarize it\
3. Meet with Kunal/Brett and discuss summary with them, and get their feedback on UI}
